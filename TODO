TODO
====
- complete command configs
  - default behaviour is "command dict-for-command *" but this could be overriden:
  - configureDict( "pers", ["pers"] ) - restrict pers command to the pers dictionary
  - configureDict( "post", ["@"]) - restrict post to files in the current directory
  - configureDict( "get", ["*","pers"]) - get and put can access global and perspectives where they need to
  - configureDict( "put", ["*","pers","*"])
  - configureDict( "help", ["_"]) - help can be sought about other commands
- have var and array commands autopopulate their own dictionaries
  - configureDict( "var", ["var"] )
  - configureDict( "array", ["array"] )
  - configureDict( "postvar", ["*","var|array","*","var|array","*","var|array","*","var|array","*","var|array"])
- post and script read files with TAB
- subsequent tabs cycle through inserted suggestions (need to remember insertion point)
- use or remove the getch for unix in initUnix
- Various other ^? key short cuts
- Document pPrompt
